# dice




A site built in [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) that is a super simple dice roller app



### Self hosting:
To self host and for developmentyou need python 3.11 or above[^1] 
in terminal, navigate to the repo folder and run 

`python -m pip install -r /requirements.txt`

to run just write `python -m reflex run` in the command line



[^1]:version 3.11 or above is fine, older versions may work but I haven't tested them
